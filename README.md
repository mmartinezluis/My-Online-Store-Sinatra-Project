# SellBy Online Store Sinatra Project

SellBy is a Sinatra based app designed using the MVC (models, views, controllers) framework implementing RESTFful routes and covering the full CRUD cycle. 

In SellBy users have the ability to:
* Login or create a new user account.
* Own funds for making purchases upon signing up to SellBy.
* Own a shopping cart.
* Add items to their shopping cart.
* Edit the quantity of a given item in their shopping cart.
* Delete items from their shopping cart.
* Purchase items from the listings posted by other users.
* Create listings to sell items to other users.
* Edit or delete their listings.
* Earn funds from sells.
* Check a list of all his/her listings.
* Check a list of all his/her purchases.

SellBy has the potential for many more functionalities. Hence planned future improvements include:
* Add a Transaction model.
* Use the Transaction model to create an inventory for purchases and an inventory for sells.
* Add a dashboard view that shows a graph for sells and purchases over time.
* Add 'List' and 'Table' toggle buttons for switching the user's listings view and purchases view from list form to table form, and viceversa.
